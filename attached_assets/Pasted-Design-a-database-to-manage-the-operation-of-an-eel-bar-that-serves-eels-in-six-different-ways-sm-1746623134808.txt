Design a database to manage the operation of an eel bar, that serves eels in six different ways:  smoked, jellied, grilled, fried, baked and as eel sushi.  They also sell beer and sake.  Only American eels, native to the nearby Potomac River, are served.  The bar provides only delivery service; it does not have any tables or chairs.  Orders are placed over the Web, and the food and drinks are delivered.  You are to provide a method for a patron to enter an order for any of the six types of eels and beer (one type only, Fat Tire) and sake (one type only, served hot).  A table can order multiple dishes and drinks.  Management is to be able to produce reports of total sales and number of each item ordered by the week and month.
