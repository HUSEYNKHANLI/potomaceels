          <p className="mb-4 text-neutral-dark">
            Potomac Eels was established in 2020 with a simple mission: to serve the finest American 
            eels from the Potomac River, prepared in six delicious ways and delivered right to your door.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4 text-neutral-dark">
            Our founder, a culinary expert with a passion for sustainable seafood, noticed that despite 
            the rich abundance of American eels in the Potomac River, few restaurants were showcasing 
            this versatile and flavorful delicacy. Thus, Potomac Eels was born.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4 text-neutral-dark">
            Today, we pride ourselves on our commitment to sustainable fishing practices, supporting 
            local fishermen, and bringing the unique taste of expertly prepared eel dishes to homes 
            across Washington, DC and the surrounding areas.
