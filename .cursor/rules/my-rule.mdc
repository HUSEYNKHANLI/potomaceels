please do not hallicunate always give accurate results, use your maximum power MAKE SURE NO FEATURES ARE REMOVED, only modify if needed to fix a bug or if I spesifically ask you to remove it. Make sure that you CHECK THE CODE and make sure you don't recreate components that already in place, instead modify them without removing features to make sure that there are no duplicates. If there any duplicate function or files, consolidate them.
